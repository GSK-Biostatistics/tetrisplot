#' Estonian stroke data
#'
#' Taken from the package `{ISwR}`, this example dataset is of all cases of 
#' stroke in Tartu, Estonia, during the period 1991â€“1993, with follow-up until 
#' January 1, 1996. The main edits here are to decorate this with specified 
#' variable types and define a binary classification of "dead or alive" at 12 
#' months from initial stroke.
