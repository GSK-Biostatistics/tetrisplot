\description{
Taken from the package \code{{ISwR}}, this example dataset is of all cases of
stroke in Tartu, Estonia, during the period 1991â€“1993, with follow-up until
January 1, 1996. The main edits here are to decorate this with specified
variable types and define a binary classification of "dead or alive" at 12
months from initial stroke.
